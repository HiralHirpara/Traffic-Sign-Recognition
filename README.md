# Traffic Sign Recognition
Traffic-Sign-Recognition is Machine Lerning Project.

Traffic signs recognition is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to. In this project we tried many machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms. 

In Deep learning, we used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The CNN is one of the powerful and the most popular network for classifying images. 

After the model is trained, we will then test model program on new images of traffic signs we find on the web.
